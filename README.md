# YouTube Bookmarker

A Chrome/Brave extension used to add timestamps to YouTube videos.

* Bookmark and go back to a specific part of a video
* Save your progress on long form videos (courses/tutorials, podcasts...)

It's a fork from [this repository](https://github.com/raman-at-pieces/youtube-bookmarker-finished-code) by Raman Hundal who made a course on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel called [Chrome Extension â€“ Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n809nd4Zu4).

I intend to improve the design and add features.
